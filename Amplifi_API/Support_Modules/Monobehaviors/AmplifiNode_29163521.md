### Summary

`AmplifiNode` is a versatile class designed to handle different types of audio interactions in Unity, providing a comprehensive way to manage audio transitions and effects in a game environment. It leverages Unity's component system and coroutines to perform seamless audio operations based on game events and player interactions.

### Usage

This component can be added to your scene from the GameObject menu. If an `AmplifiEngine` object does not already exist in your scene, one will be created for you as it is required for the `AmplifiNode` to operate.

`AmplifiNode`'s are the bread and butter of the **Amplifi Audio Management** system and are discussed in great detail in the [Amplifi Node Configuration](Amplifi-Node-Configuration_28573705.md) section as well as in the [Video Tutorial](Video-Tutorials_29884437.md) section.
