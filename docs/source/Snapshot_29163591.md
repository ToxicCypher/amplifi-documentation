### Summary

The `Snapshot` class in the Amplifi namespace handles audio snapshots in Unity, working with `AmplifiConfig` and `AmplifiEngine`. Upon initialization, it sets an initial audio snapshot if one is defined in the configuration. The class provides a method to blend audio snapshots over a specified duration, transitioning to the target snapshot if it exists in the audio mixer, or logging a message if the snapshot is not found.
