1.  **What happens if I have not provided an AudioClip to an Amplifi Node when it is triggered at run-time?**
    
    1.  The Amplifi Engine will interpret a ‘null’ AudioClip as silence and will transition/invoke ‘null’ AudioClip’s in the same fashion as it would if an AudioClip were provided.
        

2.  **Why can’t I see Amplifi Nodes when in the Scene View?**
    
    1.  Amplifi node visualizations is currently only available for nodes with the Trigger Shape setting set to Mesh.
