### Summary

The `Music` class in the Amplifi namespace manages audio tracks and their transitions within a Unity project. It initializes and configures two audio sources, `current` and `next`, to handle track changes. The class allows transitioning between tracks with specified settings and context, adjusting volumes smoothly, and ensuring seamless playback. It employs coroutines to manage these transitions and swaps audio sources when needed. The class also includes methods to configure audio sources based on context parameters and to create temporary "cadaver" audio sources to manage track transitions without interruptions.
